# Hello World!
Welcome to your maybe first lesson to making Github pages!  
Do you notice how the file is named `Reference.md`? It means the file is a **Markdown** file.  
## What is Markdown?
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a *markup language* that can be used pretty much *anywhere*  
Here's a quick explanation of what Markdown is:  
> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. As the initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and unanswered questions, many implementations and extensions of Markdown appeared over the years to answer these issues.
