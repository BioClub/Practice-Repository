# Hello World!
Welcome to your maybe first lesson to making Github pages!  
Do you notice how the file is named `Reference.md`? It means the file is a **Markdown** file.  
## What is Markdown?
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a *markup language* that can be used pretty much *anywhere*  
Here's a quick explanation of what Markdown is:  
> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. As the initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and unanswered questions, many implementations and extensions of Markdown appeared over the years to answer these issues.  

So, let's take a look at the code that wrote everything above!

The `# Hello World` is called a **Header**. Any text after the hashtag will be a header. The size of the text can be adjusted with the amount of #'s like so:
## This is 2 #s.
### This is 3 #s.
#### This is 4 #s.
##### This is 5 #s.
###### This is 6 #s.
####### This is 7 #s. The maximum is 6.

Do you want to know how I did `this`? Just add backticks ( \` ) to the front and end of the text you want to apply the **Inline code**.  
Notice how some text are **bolded** and some are *emphasised (italics)?* They are done by applying asterisks like so `**Bolded**` and `*emphasis*`
